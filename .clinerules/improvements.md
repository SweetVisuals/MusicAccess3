# Development Improvement Guidelines

## Intuitive Development Approach
- Always analyze the code context thoroughly before making changes
- Make comprehensive, production-ready improvements beyond just the immediate request
- Predict related changes needed for consistency and best practices
- Consider the broader impact of changes across the codebase

## Critical Rules [CRITICAL COMPLIANCE REQUIRED]
- FOLLOW ALL PROJECT RULES AT ALL TIMES
- When given a prompt, analyze the full context and make intuitive improvements
- Go beyond the immediate request to ensure production-quality code
- Document all assumptions and reasoning behind changes

## Implementation Standards
1. **Code Analysis**:
   - Review related components and dependencies
   - Check for consistency with existing patterns
   - Verify TypeScript types and interfaces

2. **Change Scope**:
   - Make all necessary related changes, not just the explicit request
   - Update documentation and tests when modifying functionality
   - Consider performance and accessibility impacts

3. **Quality Assurance**:
   - Validate changes against project standards
   - Ensure proper error handling and edge cases
   - Maintain clean, well-structured code
